## Project Vision

### What is your vision for this offering?

Learn, Work, Sell is a place where people can choose skills to level up at and 
then find work at it, or sell their products if that is what the skill is about.

### What defines success for this project?


### What are the potential pitfalls (i.e. what keeps you up at night about this project)?

2. I don't have the discipline to complete it.

### Who is primary?

All of them.

### Role(s)?

## Value Proposition

### What problems do users have that this offering solves?

At the moment there is no straightforward connection between learning skills and 
earning money from it. The problems are:

1. There is no agreed upon, high quality way of learning valuable skills. 
Learners must find out paths by themselves, and spend a lot of time doing so.

2. There is anxiety about finding gainful employment, or earning money otherwise 
from it, even if they decide on a path and are good on their way on learning 
a skill. This is the place of disconnect.

### What is the core value prop of the offering?

We offer our users context and information so they can relax and enjoy their 
path towards learning knowing that their efforts objectivelly have a great 
chance of being rewarded.

### What are the main marketing messages?

1. Don't know what to do with your life? We can help.

2. Want to employ your current skills profitably, or learn new ones? We can 
help.
